          Senior software engineers need an incredibly complex array of skills. This is something that
          could only come with lots of time, and is not something any person should aim to be right out of college.
          However, senior software engineers will also need good soft skills because they will be in charge of leading
          a team. They will need good communication, listening skills, time management, mentorship, critical thinking,
          and paying attention to detail. Due to its high requirements, many software engineers may never reach this
          status throughout their whole career.

      Colleges will likely have a career center to provide help with editing a resume, preparing for an interview, and job applications.
      Coding boot camps can also offer similar services and potentially will be even more beneficial as these programs are focused on
      getting individuals into the work force. It is best to obtain as much advice as possible about from available career centers near you.
      Specifically in the world of software engineering, many interviews will be skill-based rather than resume-based, and will require you to
      solve a few different problems related to anything software engineering.
